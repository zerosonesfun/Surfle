A Webring is a loop or chain of websites connected together that you can easily browse through. Surfle has a few modes:
1. **Surfle Mode** - Browse through any official Surfle Webring. Overtime, additional Webrings will be added and you can change to a different one from the Settings page (click on the settings cog wheel icon at the top right of the extension's main popup).
2. **Bookmarks Mode** - Any of your own bookmarks folders can be selected as the list of websites you browse through.
3. Either mode can be surfed in order or you can check off **Random Mode** for a random experience.
