A Webring is a loop or chain of websites connected together that you can easily browse through. Surfle has two modes:
1. **Surfle Mode** - Browse through the official Surfle Webring.
2. **Bookmarks Mode** - Any bookmarks folder with "webring" in the name can be selected as the list of websites you browse through.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è How to Install & Use
Getting started with Surfle is super easy. Once we‚Äôre officially live in the Chrome Web Store, here‚Äôs how to install it:

### üîß Install in Seconds

1. **Go to the Chrome Web Store**
   Visit the Surfle extension page here:
   [chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/surfle/your-extension-id](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/surfle/your-extension-id)
   (Link will be updated when live!)

2. **Click ‚ÄúAdd to Chrome‚Äù**
   A confirmation popup will appear. Click **Add Extension**.

3. **That‚Äôs it!**
   Surfle will now appear as a small turtle üê¢ icon in your browser toolbar.

### üåÄ Start Surfing

1. Click the **Surfle** icon to open the popup.
2. Toggle **Surfle Mode** on to surf the official webring.
3. Or switch to **Bookmarks Mode** and pick your own webring folder. Any browser bookmarks folder with webring in the name is selectable.
4. Click **Start Surfle** and use keyboard arrows (‚Üê ‚Üí) or mobile taps to navigate.

### üòé Create a Webring Mix

Create a folder of bookmarks that your friends might like, name the folder webring-whatever (the webring part is important), and export. Send it to a friend who also uses Surfle. How do you export? This could be a feature in a future version of Surfle, but for now you can search the Chrome Extension store for "export bookmarks" and use something [like this](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bookmark-importexport/gdhpeilfkeeajillmcncaelnppiakjhn).
