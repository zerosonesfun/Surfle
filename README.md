A Webring is a loop or chain of websites connected together that you can easily browse through. Surfle has two modes:
1. Surfle Mode - Browse through the official Surfle Webring.
2. Bookmarks Mode - Any bookmarks folder with "webring" in the name can be selected as the list of websites you browse through.
